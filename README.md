# savoy-truffle
"Creme tangerine and Montelimar
A ginger sling with a pineapple heart
Coffee dessert, yes, you know it's good news
But you'll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle"
The Beatles 1968 (concieved by Ringo whilst playing with the Solidity testing framework whilst staying in the Savoy Hotel, London.)

Playing around with truffle.
